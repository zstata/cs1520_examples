/**
 * Your task for this reciation is play around with higher order functions
 * (map, fold, filter) in rust. Notice that these fucntions can only be applied
 * to iterators and also return iterators (except for fold). You can use
 * .collect() to convert the results back into a collection. Also, since
 * these functions can return iterators you can chain them together as well.

fn main() {
	//Problem 1
	// Produce a vector that contains even numbers in the range (1 to 10)
	// inclusive Hint: use range (1..11) and filter


	//Problem 2
	// Use the vector produced in problem 1 and find the sum of all the numbers
	// contained in it Hint: use fold


	//Problem 3
	// Repeat problem 2 but now multiply the numbers and assume an initial
	// multiplier of 2
	// Hint: you just need to change one parameter of fold


	//Problem 4
	// Take the square of all elements of the vector which was produced in
	// problem 1
	// Hint: use map


	//Problem 5
	// Find the sum of all prime numbers in the range (100 to 200) inclusive
	// Hint: define a function is_prime, use filter and then fold
